1.) 
	QUESTION : 
	A commercial fisherman notices the following
	relationship between hours spent fishing and the
	quantity of fish caught:
	Hours Quantity of Fish (in pounds)
		0 0
		1 10
		2 18
		3 24
		4 28
		5 30

a. What is the marginal product of each hour spent
fishing?
b. Use these data to graph the fisherman’s production
function. Explain its shape.
c. The fisherman has a fixed cost of $10 (his pole). The
opportunity cost of his time is $5 per hour. Graph
the fisherman’s total-cost curve. Explain its shape.


SOLUTION : 
	a. Total product, TP = Q
		Marginal product, MP = Change in TP / Change in Hours

	  Hours (TP) MP
		0	0	
		1	10	10
		2	18	8
		3	24	6
		4	28	4
		5	30	2

	b. (Draw Graph)













	The production function is a diminishing production function: As Hours (input) increase, output (TP) increases at a lower rate. So the marginal product is reducing (diminishing) as more inputs are added.

	c.  (Draw Graph) 















	FC = $10. Opportunity cost = $5 per hour.
		Total cost = FC + Hourly opportunity cost x number of hours
		TC = 10 + 5H

		The TC curve is a straight line, whose intercept = $10 (FC). After this level, TC increases linearly with increase in H (and increase in Q).




2.) QUESTION : 
		a. Complete this puzzle, filling in the missing numbers using the information provided.
		b. Draw four different cost curves in the same X-Y plane as you complete the table. i.e.,
		MC curve, ATC curve, AVC curve and AFC curve.
		c. Discuss about some important features of the shape of MC, ATC and the relationship
		between marginal and ATC. (Hint: textbook p.268-p.271)





3.) QUESTION : 
	The city government is considering two tax proposals:
		• A lump-sum tax of $300 on each producer of
		hamburgers.
		• A tax of $1 per burger, paid by producers of
		hamburgers.
	a. Which of the following curves—average fixed cost,
		average variable cost, average total cost, and marginal
		cost—would shift as a result of the lump-sum
		tax? Why? Show this in a graph. Label the graph as
		precisely as possible.
	b. Which of these same four curves would shift as
		a result of the per-burger tax? Why? Show this
		in a new graph. Label the graph as precisely as
		possible.



	SOLUTION : 
	(GRAPHS ON ATTACHED SHEET)

	a) A lunmpsum tax increases the fixed cost component, so there will be a chnage in AFC, and ATC curves. As the AFC and ATC are derived from the FC compenet we can see a shift in these two curves.
	b) But for a tax on output, it adds cost to variable costs. So there will be a change in VC occurs, due to this there will be a changes in the AVC, ATC and MC curves takes place as these are derived from VC.
	An illustration and graphs of these changes are given below.



4.) QUESTION : 
	
	Consider the following table of long-run total costs for
	three different firms:

	Quantity    1   2   3   4    5    6    7
		Firm A $60 $70 $80 $90 $100 $110 $120
		Firm B  11  24  39  56   75  96   119
		Firm C  21  34  49  66   85  106  129

	Does each of these firms experience economies of scale
	or diseconomies of scale?


	SOLTUION : 

		Firm A : Economies of Scale   

		Firm B : Diseconomies of Scale

		Firm C : Economic and Diseconomies of Scale
